% \section{Commit Survey Design and Objectives}
% \label{sec:appendix:survey}

% To gain deeper insights into the design and evolution of the eBPF subsystem, we developed a comprehensive survey aimed at classifying commits within the Linux eBPF subsystem. This survey evaluates specific aspects of each commit by analyzing commit messages and associated code changes. In cases where the commit message provides insufficient information, respondents are allowed to select an ``I'm not sure'' option.

% The primary goals of the survey are to:

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Provide concise summaries of each commit.
%     \item Extract key themes and components affected by each commit.
%     \item Classify commits based on their type, complexity, and impacted components.
%     \item Identify patterns and trends in the evolution of the eBPF subsystem.
% \end{itemize}

% \subsection{Survey Structure}

% The survey consists of a series of structured questions designed to capture the essential characteristics of each commit. Respondents are encouraged to be as specific as possible based on the available commit message and code changes. If the commit message lacks clarity, the ``I'm not sure'' option can be selected.

% \subsection{Simplified Survey Definition}

% Below is the simplified survey structure:

% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item \textbf{Summary}: Provide a one-sentence summary of the commit (max 30 words).
%     \item \textbf{Keywords}: Extract up to three keywords from the commit.
%     \item \textbf{Commit Classification} (\emph{Single Choice}): What is the main type of the commit?
%     \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
%         \item Bug fix
%         \item New feature
%         \item Performance optimization
%         \item Code cleanup or refactoring
%         \item Documentation change or typo fix
%         \item Test case or test infrastructure change
%         \item Build system or CI/CD change
%         \item Security fix
%         \item Merge commit
%         \item Other type of commit
%         \item I'm not sure
%     \end{enumerate}
%     \item \textbf{Commit Complexity} (\emph{Single Choice}): Estimate the complexity of implementing this commit.
%     \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
%         \item Simple (affects 1--20 lines or 1--2 files)
%         \item Moderate (affects 21--100 lines or a few files)
%         \item Complex (affects over 100 lines or 5+ files)
%         \item Merge-like (merges multiple branches or features)
%         \item Non-code or generated changes
%         \item I'm not sure
%     \end{enumerate}
%     \item \textbf{Major Related Implementation Component} (\emph{Single Choice}): What is the main implementation component modified?
%     \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
%         \item eBPF verifier
%         \item eBPF JIT compiler
%         \item Helpers and kfuncs
%         \item Syscall interface
%         \item eBPF maps
%         \item \texttt{libbpf} library
%         \item \texttt{bpftool} utility
%         \item Test cases and makefiles
%         \item Changes in other subsystems related to eBPF events
%         \item Merge commit
%         \item Other component related to eBPF
%         \item Unrelated to eBPF subsystem
%         \item I'm not sure
%     \end{enumerate}
%     \item \textbf{Major Related Logic Component} (\emph{Single Choice}): What is the main logic component affected?
%     \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]

%         \item Maps logic
%         \item BPF Type Format (BTF) logic
%         \item Merge commit
%         \item General utilities logic
%         \item Other eBPF logic component
%         \item Unrelated to eBPF subsystem
%         \item I'm not sure
%     \end{enumerate}
%     \item \textbf{Use Cases or Submodule Events} (\emph{Multiple Choice}): What eBPF use cases or subsystem events does the commit relate to?
