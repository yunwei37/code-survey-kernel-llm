# KernelSurvey Revision Plan: Transforming \sys into a Multi-Agent Framework

## Overview
Transform the current "\sys" paper into "KernelSurvey: A Multi-Agent LLM Framework for Understanding the Linux Kernel" to align with AIware 2025 conference themes.

## Target Conference Themes
1. **How will inner and open source collaboration evolve in the FM era?**
2. **How to integrate legacy software in future AIware?**

## Major Changes Required

### 1. Title and Positioning
- **Old**: \sys: An LLM-Driven Methodology for Analyzing Large-Scale Codebases
- **New**: KernelSurvey: A Multi-Agent LLM Framework for Understanding the Linux Kernel

### 2. Core Narrative Transformation
Transform from a single LLM survey methodology to a multi-agent system that simulates the Linux OSS community:
- Each agent represents different stakeholders (maintainers, contributors, security experts, historians)
- Agents collaborate to understand and analyze kernel changes
- Focus on how this mirrors real OSS collaboration in the FM era

### 3. Abstract Rewrite
Focus on:
- Multi-agent collaboration for legacy system understanding
- Virtual Linux community of specialized LLM agents
- Bridge between legacy C/Makefile systems and modern AI tooling
- Evolution of OSS collaboration patterns through agent consensus

### 4. Methodology Section Overhaul

#### Current Structure:
- Single LLM processes commits
- Survey design principles
- Data extraction and analysis

#### New Multi-Agent Architecture:
```
1. Orchestrator Agent (workflow coordination)
2. Survey Designer Agent (methodology expert)
3. Community Proxy Agents:
   - Maintainer Agent (stability focus)
   - Contributor Agent (feature perspective)
   - Security Expert Agent (vulnerability analysis)
   - Historian Agent (evolution patterns)
4. Adjudicator/QA Agent (consensus building)
5. Data Loader Agent (structured output)
```

### 5. Key Technical Additions

#### Agent Interaction Protocol:
- Agents read kernel artifacts (commits, LKML emails, docs)
- Each provides perspective-based analysis
- Consensus mechanisms (majority vote, Cohen's kappa)
- Self-consistency checks and debate resolution

#### Implementation Framework:
- AutoGen/CrewAI for orchestration
- Natural language inter-agent communication
- Async parallel processing for scalability
- Human-in-the-loop for low-agreement cases

### 6. Case Study Adjustments

#### Emphasize:
- How different agents interpret the same eBPF commits
- Divergence patterns between maintainer vs contributor views
- Evolution of collaboration patterns over time
- Integration challenges for legacy kernel code

#### New Analysis:
- Inter-agent agreement metrics
- Stakeholder perspective evolution
- Legacy integration pain points identified by agents

### 7. AIware-Specific Contributions

#### Inner/Open Source Collaboration Evolution:
- Quantify maintainer-contributor view divergence
- Track consensus patterns over kernel history
- Predict future collaboration challenges

#### Legacy Software Integration:
- Multi-agent layer as cognition service
- SQL/GraphQL interface to legacy C code
- No kernel modification required
- Future-proof AI tooling integration

### 8. Related Work Updates
Add references to:
- Multi-agent systems in software engineering
- AI-assisted code understanding
- Legacy system modernization
- OSS collaboration studies

### 9. Evaluation Enhancements
- Agent agreement statistics
- Comparison with human expert surveys
- Scalability metrics for multi-agent processing
- Legacy code understanding accuracy

### 10. Future Work Alignment
- Expanding agent personas
- Cross-project agent transfer learning
- Real-time kernel development assistance
- Integration with existing kernel tools

## Implementation Timeline
1. Update title and abstract (immediate)
2. Revise introduction with AIware themes
3. Transform methodology to multi-agent architecture
4. Adjust case study presentation
5. Add agent interaction examples
6. Update conclusions for conference fit

## Key Messages for AIware
1. Multi-agent systems can model OSS community dynamics
2. Legacy systems become accessible through AI cognition layers
3. Agent consensus reveals collaboration evolution patterns
4. Future of kernel development is AI-augmented, not replaced

## Technical Diagrams Needed
1. Multi-agent architecture diagram
2. Agent interaction flow
3. Consensus building process
4. Legacy-to-AI integration layer

This revision positions KernelSurvey as a concrete example of how AI can understand and integrate with legacy systems while revealing insights about OSS collaboration evolution.
